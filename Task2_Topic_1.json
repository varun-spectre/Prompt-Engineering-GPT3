        "Output": "This rock is most likely a shale, which is a type of sedimentary rock. Shale typically forms in environments where there is a lot of sediment, such as in river deltas, lakes, and oceans. The sediment is usually composed of small pieces of organic matter, such as algae, and mineral particles. Over time, the sediment becomes compacted and cemented together to form shale. Shale is typically dark in color and has a brittle texture. It can easily break into thin layers. Shale is found all over the world and is a common type of rock used in construction. It is not very valuable, but can be used for things like roofing, flooring, and paving. Shale can also be used to make cement and bricks. There are several subclasses of shale, based on its composition and properties. For example, black shale is a type of shale that is rich in organic matter and can be used to create oil and gas."
