The topography and climate suggest that the area was once part of a large volcano range. The soil is very fertile because of the lava. The water is salt water because of the location. There are no trees because of the extreme heat. The minerals present are most likely to be iron and magnesium. There are a lot of animal fossils because they were preserved in the lava. The landforms present are mountains and valleys."
